<h1>Triggers</h1>
<p>Triggers define under which circumstances a process will be
instantiated. They are events, which either start a process
automatically or - as in the case of a manual trigger - allow an
external event to initiate a process start. There are several types of
triggers enabling process start by different resources: a performer, an
incoming mail, a point in time or a JMS message. Each process needs at
least one trigger, needs to be used as a sub-process or by an event
action in order to be executed.</p>
<p>Please refer to the chapter <a
    href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-11.htm"
>Working with Triggers</a> to get information on how to add, modify and
delete triggers and how to set up parameters depending on the type of
trigger you use.</p>
<p>Stardust currently supports the following
trigger types:</p>
<h2>Manual Trigger</h2>
<p><img src="images/mg-defdesk-44.png" alt="manual trigger">
A manual trigger - a user having the corresponding grant can start a
process from the <strong>Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective</strong>.</p>
<h2>Timer Based Trigger</h2>
<p><img src="images/mg-defdesk-46.png" alt="timer trigger">
A timer-based trigger - a process can be started at some point in
time, whereby multiple instances of the process can be created depending
on the defined periodicity.</p>
<h2>Mail Trigger</h2>
<p><img src="images/mg-defdesk-41.png" alt="mail trigger">
A mail trigger - an incoming email starts a process passing all the
information contained in the email as input data.</p>
<h2>JMS Trigger</h2>
<p><img src="images/mg-defdesk-37.png" alt="JMS trigger">
A JMS trigger - an incoming message starts a process passing all the
information contained in the body of the message as input data.</p>
<p>For additional configurations and use of the respective
trigger, refer to the <a
    href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-daemons.html"
>Managing Daemons</a> and the <a
    href="../../handbooks/operation/audit-trail/ag-appendix-audittrail.html"
>Audit Trail Model</a> chapter of the <a
    href="../../handbooks/operation/ag-preface.htm"
> Operation Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Scan Trigger</h2>
<p><img src="images/mg-defdesk-scan.png" alt="Scan trigger"> A scan trigger -  
starts process instances via an implemented Scan tool.
