<h1>Monitoring Worklists</h1>
<p>To provide a worklist monitor which will be informed about changes
to the worklist, you can implement the interface
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/core/spi/monitoring/IWorklistMonitor.html">
org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring.IWorklistMonitor</a>.</p>
<pre>
package org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring;

import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.model.IParticipant;
import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.runtime.beans.IActivityInstance;

public interface IWorklistMonitor
{

   void addedToWorklist(IParticipant participant, IActivityInstance activityInstance);

   void removedFromWorklist(IParticipant participant, IActivityInstance activityInstance);

}
</pre>
<p>This pattern follows the concept of the JDK6 <tt>ServiceLoader.</tt></p>
<p>The <strong>participant</strong> parameter defines the participant 
to whose worklist the activity instance has been added and from whose
worklist the activity instance has been removed respectively.
<strong>activityInstance</strong> specifies the activity instance 
which is affected.</p>
<p>Create your own implementations for this interface. 
To publish an implementor to the engine, a file named by the interface's 
factory has to be created in the <tt>/META-INF/services</tt> folder of the jar
as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the <tt><nobr>carnot-engine.jar</nobr></tt> file,
	located in the root directory of the original <tt>carnot.ear</tt> file.
   <div class="ipp">Refer to chapter 
    <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.installation/html/installation/ig-maven.html">
    Creating a Stardust Runtime Environment with Apache Maven</a>
    in the
    <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.installation/html/installation/ig-toc.html">
    Installation Guide</a> for details on how to retrieve the
    <tt>carnot.ear</tt> file from one of the preconfigured deployment 
    configurations.</div></li>
	<li>In folder <tt>/META-INF/services</tt>, create the following file:
	<pre>org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring.IWorklistMonitor</pre></li>
	<li>Add the fully qualified class name of your implementations to the file 
	named as the interface, which the class implements.</li>
</ol>
<p>The methods in this class are called (on <tt>Session.flush()</tt>)
in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>addedToWorklist()</tt>: <br>
	 Method is called at the end of transaction, when the 
	 current performer of the activity instance has changed and is not null.</li>
	<li><tt>removedFromWorklist()</tt>:<br>
	 This method is called at the end of transaction,
	 when the previous performer of the activity instance 
	 has changed and is not null.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that the notifications are not transaction save. You will be informed 
even if later in transaction a rollback happens and the change is not committed to
the database.</p>
