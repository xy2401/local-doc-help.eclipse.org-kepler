<p>For information on service operations provided by Stardust for predefined
permissions concerning departments, please refer to the section
<a href="../operation/ag-appendix-security-1.htm#applPermission">Setting Application Permissions</a>
of the chapter

in the <a href="../operation/ag-preface.htm">Operation Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="department">Department Interface</h2>
<p>Stardust provides an interface <strong>Department</strong> to describe  
departments via the following methods:</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>getDescription()</tt>: returns the description of this department.</li>
	<li><tt>getParentDepartment()</tt>: gets the parent department bound to this department.</li>	
	<li><tt>getOrganization()</tt>: gets the organization bound to this department.</li>	
	<li><tt>getScopedParticipant(ModelParticipant participant)</tt>: creates a client 
	side model participant bound to this department.</li>	
</ul>
<p>The <tt>getScopedParticipant</tt> method throws an <tt>InvalidArgumentException</tt>
if the participant argument is not compatible with the organization to which it belongs.
Compatible means that it is either the same organization or a direct member
of the organization.</p>
<h2 id="manage">Managing Departments</h2>
<p>The <strong>AdministrationService</strong> provides
the following methods for managing departments:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#createDep">Create Departments</a></li>
    <li><a href="#getDep">Retrieve Departments</a></li>
    <li><a href="#modDep">Modify Departments</a></li>
    <li><a href="#delDep">Remove Departments</a></li>
    <li><a href="#cleanUp">Delete All Existing Departments</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please also refer to the section <a href="pg-embedded-3.htm#adminservice">AdministrationService</a>
of the chapter <a href="pg-embedded-3.htm">Stardust Services</a> for information
on this service and the according Javadoc of the 
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/AdministrationService.html">
AdministrationService</a>
for detailed information on its methods and their parameter usage.</p>
<h3 id="createDep">Create Departments</h3>
<p>The method <tt>createDepartment</tt> creates a new department with the given id,
in the scope of the parent department and assigned to the specified organization.
The method has the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The id and the name must not be null or empty and must be unique in the parent scope.</li>
    <li>The department IDs are compared as Strings, without additional processing.</li>
    <li>The parent may be null. If it's null, it means it is a top level department,
    otherwise it must resolve (by OID) to an existing department.</li>
    <li>The organization must not be null and must resolve to an existing model 
    participant organization. Resolving can be performer either by <tt>runtimeOid</tt> or by Id.</li>
 </ul>
<p>Exceptions are thrown in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DepartmentExistsException</strong>:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>A department with the same Id already exists in the parent scope.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>ObjectNotFoundException</strong>:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Either the parent or the organization could not be resolved.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>InvalidArgumentException</strong>:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Either the Id or the name is null or an empty string.</li>
        <li>The organization is null.</li>
        <li>The organization does not resolve to an actual organization in the model
       (i.e. resolves to a role or conditional performer).</li>
        <li>The organization is not directly part of the organization
         to which the parent department is assigned (invalid hierarchy).</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getDep">Retrieve Departments</h3>
<p>The method <tt>getDepartment</tt> retrieves the department with the given OID.
An <tt>ObjectNotFoundException</tt> is thrown in case no department with the
given OID exists.</p>
<h3 id="modDep">Modify Departments</h3>
<p>The method <tt>modifyDepartment</tt> changes the name and the description of a department.
An <tt>ObjectNotFoundException</tt> is thrown in case no department having the
specified OID exists. If the name is null or contains an empty string, an
<tt>InvalidArgumentException</tt> is thrown.</p>

<h3 id="delDep">Remove Departments</h3>
<p>The method <tt>removeDepartment</tt>removes the department having the specified OID,
all his children and all user grants associated with the department.
An <tt>InvalidArgumentException</tt> is thrown 
if there are non-terminated or terminated work items that are associated with either the given department
or with any of its direct children. An <tt>ObjectNotFoundException</tt>
is thrown in case no department with the specified OID exists. So the instance any activity gets associated with the department, 
it cannot be deleted. Because the audit trail maintains either ActivityInstance entries or ActivityInstanceHistory entries
that references the department which has any activity associated with it. An ActivityInstanceHistory objects can be removed
only by archiving the audit trail. <!-- However, the facility to invalidate the department is provided, if it is not required anymore. --></p>

<h3 id="cleanUp">Delete All Existing Departments</h3>
<p>To delete all existing departments, you can use the <tt>cleanupRuntimeAndModels</tt>
method or the method <tt>cleanupRuntime(boolean keepUsers)</tt>.
In the <tt>cleanupRuntime(boolean keepUsers)</tt> set the parameter <tt>keepUsers</tt>,
which is a flag to specify if the users should be deleted or not, to <tt>false</tt>.</p>
<h2 id="grants">Manipulating Grants for Scoped Participants</h2>
<p>With the interface <strong>User</strong>, you can manage grants for scoped participants,
as described in detail in section
<a href="pg-declarative-security.html#grants">Adding and Removing Grants</a>
of chapter
<a href="pg-declarative-security.html">
Declarative Security Usage in Stardust Services API</a>.
<h3 id="default">Adding grants for scoped participants in their default department(s)</h3>
<p>For every distinct scope in an organizational hierarchy, there is a dedicated null department.
A scoped participant in its default department is granted to a user by granting 
his null department given by granting the organization for the superdepartment.</p>
<h3>Declarative Security effecting Scoped Participants</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#dataL">On Data, Model and Partition Level</a></li>
	<li><a href="#actL">On Activity Level</a></li>
	<li><a href="#processL">On Process Level</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dataL">On Data, Model and Partition Level</h4>
<p>If a grant is given to a scoped participant (explicitly or implicitly)
on data, model or participant level,
then all users assigned to this participant do have execution permission. 
The department is not taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="actL">On Activity Level</h4>
<p>On Activity Level each activity instance stores the department information. 
Thus, it depends on the concrete activity instance, if a user has execution 
permission. In that case, the grant including the department has to match the 
grant permission and the department of the activity instance.</p>
<h4 id="processL">On Process Level</h4>
<p>Department information is not stored in the process instance. 
Instead, the relevant process data defining the department
is evaluated on demand.</p>
<p>For example, a process definition permission is granted to a 
role <strong>Role 1</strong>. This role is a scoped role with scope data 
<strong>Data 1</strong> defining the department. If the value of 
<strong>Data 1</strong> is
executed for a specific process instance, the department required to
get the execution permission is evaluated.</p>

<h2 id="asso">Reflecting the Department Association</h2>
<p>The method <tt>getDepartment</tt> of the interface <strong>Grant</strong>, provides
the option to retrieve the department with which this grant is associated.
In case the grant has no department association, the method returns <tt>null</tt>.
Please also refer to the Javadoc of the interface
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/Grant.html">Grant</a> 
for detailed information on this interface and its methods.</p>
<p>The method <tt>findAllDepartments(DepartmentInfo parent, OrganizationInfo organization)</tt>
of the <strong>QueryService</strong> interface, retrieves a list containing all the departments
satisfying the search criteria. The search is performed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If both, <tt>parent</tt> and <tt>organization</tt>, are null, the result contains all
    top level departments, regardless of the organization to which they are assigned.</li>
    <li>If <tt>parent</tt> is not null but the <tt>organization</tt> is null, 
    result contains all direct children of the parent department, regardless of the organization 
    to which they are assigned.</li>
    <li>If <tt>parent</tt> is null, but <tt>organization</tt> is not null, 
    the result contains all departments assigned to the organization, 
    regardless of their parent department.</li>
    <li>If both, <tt>parent</tt> and <tt>organization</tt>, are not null, the result 
    contains all departments assigned to the organization, that have as direct parent
    the specified department.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting list can be empty if no departments are matching the search criteria.
An <tt>ObjectNotFoundException</tt> is thrown if one of the following cases applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Neither the parent nor the organization can be resolved.</li>
    <li>The specified Id is null or empty.</li>
    <li>There is no department with the specified Id in the parent scope.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getInfo">Distinguishing Between Scoped and Unscoped Participants</h2>
<p>To distinguish between scoped and unscoped organizations and roles,
use the method <tt>isDepartmentScoped()</tt> of the interface
<tt>ModelParticipantInfo</tt>. It returns whether the role or organization 
is modeled to support the creation of its own departments.</p>
<p>The method <tt>definesDepartmentScope()</tt> returns <tt>true</tt>,
if this particular organization defines a department scope.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Javadoc of the interface
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/model/ModelParticipantInfo.html">
org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.model.ModelParticipantInfo</a> for detailed information
on these methods.</p>
