<h1>Specifying Activities</h1>
<p>As explained in the chapter <a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-5.htm">Activities</a>, a
series of activities connected with one another by transitions constitutes the
core of the process.</p>
<p>An activity is represented in the <strong>Process Workbench</strong> in
two different ways. In the <strong>Outline</strong> view it is represented by a
small gear pictogram. In diagrams you will see an activity depicted as a box
possibly with transition symbols related to other symbols representing its
performer, its data and the application invoked by this activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-defdesk-17.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> A Representation of an Activity</p>
<h2>Creating and Deleting Activities</h2>
<p>To create an activity you can either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the diagram toolbar:
    <ol>
        <li>Select <strong>Activities</strong> under <strong>Items</strong>.</li>
        <li>From the pop-up menu, select the type of activity.</li>
        <li>Click the diagram canvas to place the activity symbol.</li>
    </ol>The created activity will also appear
    in the tree view under the process definition symbol in the <strong>Outline</strong>
    view.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Outline</strong> view:
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click the target process definition.</li>
        <li>Choose <strong>New Activity</strong> and the type of activity you want.</li>
    </ol> The
    created activity will appear in the tree view under the process definition
    symbol. Subsequently, you can drag the activity symbol onto the diagram
    canvas to create an activity symbol there.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deleting activities, you must make a distinction between deleting
an activity from the model information or only deleting a symbol from a diagram.
To do the first - delete an activity from a model - you proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having selected the symbol of the activity in the <strong>Outline</strong>
    view, choose the option <strong>Delete </strong> in the pop-up menu of this
    process definition.</li>
    <li>Having selected the symbol of the activity in a process
    definition diagram, choose the option <strong>Delete</strong> in the pop-up
    menu of this activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The option <strong>Delete Symbol </strong> in the pop-up menu called
from within the diagram canvas will only remove the activity symbol from the
diagram.</p>
<h2 id="actProperties">Modifying Activity Properties</h2>
<p>The properties of an activity are accessible in its properties dialog.
To open this dialog, right-click the activity symbol - in the <strong>Outline</strong>
view or diagram - and select the option <strong>Properties</strong>.
Double-clicking on the activity symbol will open this dialog as well.</p>
<p>Activity characteristics are bundled into the following categories,
each represented in an own pane:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#auth">Authorization</a></li>
    <li><a href="#general">General</a></li>
    <li><a href="#display">Display</a></li>
    <li><a href="#control">Control Flow</a></li>

    <li><a href="#simulation">Simulation</a></li>
    <li><a href="#effort">Effort Planning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Section <a href="#implementation">Implementation specific</a>
describes implementation specific settings, like the participant
of a manual activity.</p>

<h3 id="auth">Authorization</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Authorization</strong> section, you can set specific 
permissions for activities. Refer to section
<a href="../property-page-authorization.html#activities">
Authorization for Activities</a> of chapter
<a href="../property-page-authorization.html">Authorization</a>
for details.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>Next to a name, an ID and a description, general properties of an
activity comprise the following checkbox options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Allows Abort by Participant</strong><br><br>
    Determines whether the assigned participant may abort instances of this 
	activity in the Stardust Portal.<br>
	Note that only the activity itself is aborted, not the root process hierarchy. 
	The process instances will continue as if this activity had been completed.<br>
	This option affects the Process Portal activity operations only. It does not 
	influence the Stardust API usage.<br><br></li>
    <li><strong>Hibernate Initially</strong> (Hibernate On Creation)<br><br>
    Determines whether the activity instance should directly change its state to
    hibernated after creation - thus ending the synchronous flow here.<br><br></li>
    <li><strong>Supports relocation</strong><br><br>
    Determines if relocation is supported for this activity and it can
    be used as starting point for the relocation. This checkbox is enabled for 
    manual activities and application activities only. For
    details on relocation, refer to chapter 
    <a href="../../../concepts/executing-workflow/concept-relocation.html">Relocation of Activities</a>
    in the <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> 
    section.<br><br></li>
    <li><strong>Is relocation target</strong><br><br>Determines if the activity
    is allowed as target point of a relocation. For
    details on relocation, refer to chapter 
    <a href="../../../concepts/executing-workflow/concept-relocation.html">Relocation of Activities</a>
    in the <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> 
    section.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-defdesk-18.png"
    alt="General Activity Properties"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> General Activity Properties</p>
<p>Please note that IDs containing
         hyphens, blanks or dots and IDs starting with digits are not supported.</p>
<p>The description of the activity is displayed as tooltip text in the Stardust Portal
        when you hover the mouse over the activity name.</p>         
         
<p>In the <strong>Internationalization</strong> part you can set a locale specific name for
the activity, as described in detail in chapter <a
    href="../mg-internationalization.html">Native Language Support</a>.</p>
<h3 id="display">Display</h3>
<p>For this property a checkbox is provided to mark activities as auxiliary
from a business perspective. This option is disabled by default, except for the route activities.
Auxiliary activities marked as <strong>Is Auxiliary Activity</strong>
will be treated equivalent to route activities in the process history.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/activity-props-display.png"
    alt="Display Option"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Is Auxiliary Activity Option</p>
<p>For route activities, this option 
is set to <strong>Is Auxiliary Activity</strong> per default.</p> 
<h4>Auxiliary subprocess activities</h4>
<p>Please note that if a subprocess activity is defined as an auxiliary activity, a disabled
<strong>Show/Hide auxiliary activities</strong> filter button in the Stardust Portals
process history also hides all following activities in this subprocess.</p>

<h3 id="control">Control Flow</h3>
<p>Control flow options define the split, join and loop behavior around
the activity.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-defdesk-19.png"
    alt="Control Flow Options"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Control Flow Options</p>
<p><strong>Join </strong>behavior specifies the runtime behavior in case of multiple
transitions from the predecessor activity leading to the chosen activity. The
following options are offered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All incoming transitions are required to be processed for the
    execution of the activity (join with the <strong>AND</strong> option).</li>
    <li>If one incoming transition is processed the chosen activity is
    instantiated (join with the<strong> XOR</strong> option). If multiple
    incoming transitions are processed at runtime the chosen activity is
    instantiated multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<p><Strong> Split </Strong> behavior specifies how multiple transitions to the following
activities are to be executed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>all (split with the <strong>AND</strong> option)</li>
    <li>or one of them (split with <strong>XOR</strong> option).</li>
</ul>
<p>See also <a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-6.htm">Control Flow</a> for basic
informations.</p>

<p><strong>Loop </strong>behavior specifies how an activity is repeated 
until the loop condition is fulfilled. During the runtime execution of loop activity   
the specific part of the workflow is repeated.</p>
<p> When an activity enters the loop, one or more instances of the activity are created and performed.
On termination of the activity instance, the loop condition is evaluated and based on the result 
 a new activity instance is created. This is repeated until the loop gets terminated and then
the subsequent activity is performed, if any.</p>
<p> None indicates that the activity is performed exactly once regardless of the evaluation of the condition.
The following loop conditions can be applied when the activity needs to be performed more than once. </p>

<ul>
	<li> While - indicates that the condition is evaluated before the creation of an activity
	instance. If the condition evaluation result is TRUE, an activity instance is created and performed.
	If FALSE, the workflow continues and the next activity is performed. Using "while" loop it 
	is possible that no activity instance is created.</li>
	<li> Repeat - indicates that the condition is evaluated at the completion of the activity instance.
	If the condition evaluation result is TRUE, the loop ends and the next activity is performed.
	If FALSE, a new instance of the activity is created and repeated.</li>

</ul>
<p> The syntax language for the loop condition parameter is carnotEL. Currently, the single line format 
is supported. The following figure explains the While loop condition.</p>
<p class ="image"><img src = "images/while-loop.png" alt="">

<strong>Figure:</strong>While Loop Condition</p>
      
<p> More elaborate cycles in the model
should be modeled explicitly by cycles in the activity/transition graph. See
figure below.</p>

<h3 id="event">Event Handling</h3>
<p>For details on event handling refer to chapter 
<a href="../mg-defdesk-13.htm">Working With Activity Event Handlers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="indata">In Data Mappings</h3>
<p>The activity properties dialog allows you to add and remove data
mappings belonging to this activity. The In data mapping maps workflow data to
the input of the activity. The mapping is interpreted depending on the activity
implementation type. In comparison to the data mappings properties dialog you
will find here all data mapped to this activity. Refer to <a
    href="../mg-defdesk-8.htm">Specifying Data Mappings</a> for more information on mapping
data to applications via an activity.</p>
<h3 id="outdata">Out Data Mappings</h3>
<p>The activity properties dialog allows you to add and remove data
mappings belonging to this activity. The Out data mapping maps workflow data to
the output of the activity. The mapping is interpreted depending on the activity
implementation type. In comparison to the data mappings properties dialog you
will find here all data mapped to this activity. Refer to <a
    href="../mg-defdesk-8.htm">Specifying Data Mappings</a> for more information on mapping
data to applications via an activity.</p>
<h3 id="controlling">Controlling Parameters</h3>
<p>The following controlling parameters are available for activities:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Measure</strong></li>

<h4 id="resource">Resource Performance Calculation</h4>
<p>This property has the default
value <tt>include</tt> for interactive activities and <tt>not include</tt> for 
non-interactive activities. It is used in the Business Control Center view 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/view-resources/bcc-views-resource.html">
Resource Performance</a> view,
where all activities having this controlling property set to <tt>include</tt> are
included into the calculation.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>In case you choose to mark the activity for quality assurance,
select the checkbox for <strong>Quality Assurance Activity</strong>.
Note that activities having a conditional performer as default performer
are not supported to be marked for quality assurance.
In case the default performer of the activity is a conditional performer,
selecting the checkbox results in an inconsistency error.
The following fields become available:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>QA Participant:</strong> In the drop-down list choose the 
    participant for quality assurance. All scoped and unscoped roles and
    organizations are available except conditional
    performers.</li>
    <li><strong>Default Probability:</strong> Enter the
    default probability as an Integer value between 0 and 100.
    The default value is 100%.</li>

    <li><a href="#manual">Manual activities</a></li>
    <li><a href="#appl">Application activities</a></li>
    <li><a href="#subprocess">Subprocess activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter <a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-5.htm">Activities</a>
of the <a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-preface.htm">Workflow Basics</a>
concepts part describes the concepts of these implementations.</p>
<p>The type of activity and related details are set in the
implementation section of activity properties. To set the type to manual
activity or route activity, a selection of the type and providing the parameters
in the implementation section is sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="root">Route Activities</h3>
<p>There is no special implementation setting for route activities, as they
mainly serve as routers.</p>
<h3 id="manual">Manual Activities</h3>
<p>The implementation setting for manual activities is the participant to
perform this activity. Select a performer in the provided list or via a
role-assignment in the diagram.</p>
<p>You have the option to convert manual activities to JSF application
activities. Please refer to chapter <a href="mg-convert-activities.html">Converting
Manual Activities to JSF Application Activities</a> for more information on this
issue.</p>
<h3 id="appl">Application Activities</h3>
<p>In the case of the application type, an application has to be created in
the model. It can be linked to the activity by selecting it from the provided
list or by an executed-by connection in the diagram. All execution parameters
for the application are set in the properties dialog pertaining to the
application.</p>
<h3 id="subprocess">Subprocess Activities</h3>
<p>To define an activity as a subprocess, select <strong>Subprocess</strong>
as the type of the activity. In the properties dialog, select the desired process from
list of existing process definitions.<br />
