<h2 id="import">Importing Model Elements</h2>
<p>The import of model elements is only possible, if a global lock is
set. This can be achieved by the <strong>Lock All For Editing</strong>
option. Please refer to the section <a href="con-locking.html#lockAll">
Locking all Lockable Elements</a> of the chapter <a href="con-locking.html">Locking
and Unlocking Elements</a> for detailed information on this option.</p>
<p>In case you try to import model elements without owning a global lock on
the target model, the following error message requesting to obtain a global lock
first is displayed:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/import-lock-warning.png" alt="Error Message"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Message Dialog to indicate the required Lock.</p>
<h2 id="process">Editing Process Definitions</h2>
<p>If a process definition is not locked for editing, no
elements pertaining to process definitions like activities, triggers,
transitions or data paths, can be added, removed or edited in this
process definition.</p>
<h2 id="diagrams">Editing Diagrams</h2>
<h3>Editing Process Diagrams</h3>
<p>Process diagrams are not editable, if the parent process definition
is not locked. You can open them in read-only mode, which means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Symbols cannot be moved.</li>
    <li>No symbols can be added, deleted, cut, copied or pasted.</li>
    <li>No drag and drop from the Outline view is possible.</li>
    <li>Options from the toolbar palette cannot be used.</li>
    <li>Model elements pertaining to the process definition cannot be renamed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagram in locked state might contain model elements like participants, applications
or data, that can be changed independently. In case these elements are locked for editing,
they can be edited from within the diagram, like opening the property dialog, 
renaming and deleting, but their symbols have the same restrictions as all
element symbols in a non-editable diagram.</p>

<p>In case you try to edit a model element pertaining to the process definition or
another element, which is not in locked state, a message dialog opens to notify that
the element has to be locked first:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/diagram-element-lock-warning.png" alt="Lock First Warning"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Message Dialog requesting Lock on Element.</p>

<h3>Editing Model Diagrams</h3>
<p>In case a model diagram is not locked for editing, you can open it
in read-only mode, as described for process diagrams.</p>
<p>The behavior of the contained symbols pertaining to model elements is the
same as described for process diagrams.</p>
<h2 id="property">Editing Mode in Property Dialogs</h2>
<p>Property dialogs of model elements of a model in <strong>Concurrency
Management Mode</strong> are displaying all control fields in read-only mode. To edit
content, a button <strong>Lock for Editing</strong> is provided at the bottom of the
dialog. Clicking this button will lock the corresponding model element or, if
the model element to be edited is only part of a lockable element, its
containing element.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lock-for-editing-props.png" 
alt="Property Dialog Example"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Property Dialog in read-only Mode.</p>
<p>In case the lock attempt fails, an according error dialog opens and all
controls stay in readonly mode.</p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/lock-problem-props_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/lock-problem-props.png" alt="Error Dialog"></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Error Dialog</p>
<!-- is removed from properties dialog (temporarily?)
<p>To unlock the model element, select the <strong>Revert Changes</strong> button in
the lower right corner of the property dialog. This option will revert
your changes, unlock the model element and set the entry fields
to read-only state. Please refer to the chapter 
<a href="con-revert.html">Reverting Changes</a> for detailed information
on reverting changes.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/revert-changes-button-props.png" alt="Revert"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Revert Changes.</p>-->
<p>Property dialogs of elements pertaining to a process definition are
not editable if the parent process definition is not locked.</p>
<h2 id="copy">Cut, Copy and Paste Operations</h2>
<p>In case model elements are copied to a model in concurrency mode, the new
elements will be displayed as newly added elements in the Outline view
and provided to be committed in the commit dialog. In case a diagram or 
process definition, where a copied element should
be pasted, is not locked, a warning dialog opens to indicate that
the target element has to be locked first.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/paste-warning.png" alt="Paste Warning"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Message Dialog requesting Lock.</p>

<h2 id="direct">Renaming Model Elements</h2>
<p>Direct editing of symbol names, like using the <strong>F2</strong> short
key or a mouse click on the name, requires a lock for editing on the according element or
a lock on the according process definition accordingly.
Otherwise a message dialog opens to inform that a lock has to be achieved
before.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lock-element-first.png" alt=" Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lock Failed Dialog</p>

<h2 id="creating">Creating New Elements</h2>
<p>If new lockable model elements are created, their according lock file will not be
created and submitted immediately, this is done on commit. New elements pertaining to
a parent node, for example a process definition, can only be created, if the parent node
is locked for editing.</p>
<p>For all lockable element, the newly created 
element is indicated as new with an overlay icon displaying a plus sign 
in the right upper corner of the element icon:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/plus-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Icon indicating an added model element.</p>
<h2 id="delete">Deleting Elements</h2>
<p>A confirmation dialog open when deleting a lockable element:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delete-confirm.png"
    alt="Deletion Confirmation Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Deletion Confirmation Dialog</p>
<p>To delete any element a lock must be obtained before the user can delete
the element. Deleting activities or other elements pertaining to a process
definition, requires a lock of the according process definition. In case 
the parent process definition is not locked, the <strong>Delete</strong>
option is not available.</p>
<h3>Deleting Elements having Symbols in a Diagram</h3>
<p>In case an element is deleted having symbols in a diagram, that is 
locked for editing, the symbols are also deleted. If the according diagram is not
locked for editing, the symbols are not deleted, but replaced with undefined 
symbols.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/undefined-element.png" 
	alt="Undefined Model Element"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Deleted Element replaced by an undefined Element.</p>
<h3>Indication to other Users</h3>
<p>In case a user deletes a lockable model element and commits this change,
this is indicated in the appropriate model element in the Outline
view to other users by an overlay icon representing a cross.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cross-remotely-icon.png" 
	alt="Model Element deleted remotely."><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Model Element deleted remotely.</p>
<!--<h2 id="changes">Model Element Changes Indication</h2>
<p>In the Outline view, changes on model elements are indicated via
an overlay icon in the right upper corner on the model element icon.
These indicate the following sort of changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#localChange">Local and Remote Changes</a></li>
    <li><a href="#added">Added Element</a></li>
    <li><a href="#deleted">Deleted Element</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="localChange">Local and Remote Changes</h3>
<p>In case a model element has local or remote changes that are not committed yet, an
overlay icon showing a pen is displayed in the right upper corner of the element
icon in the Outline view:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/pen-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Icon indicating local changes.</p>
<p>You can differ if the changes are local or remote by the overlay icon
in the lower right corner indicating the model element state, which is
described in section <a href="#state">Model Element State Indication</a>.
Thus, a barrel icon or a locked sign icon combined with the pen icon indicates
that the model element has been changed by another user. In that case, an
update might be useful. For example:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/pen-barrel-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Icon indicating remote changes.</p>
<p>Whereas the checkmark icon combined with the pen icon indicates local changes
that are not committed yet.</p>
<h3 id="added">Added Element</h3>
<p>In case a model element is locally added and not committed yet, or
a model element is added remotely, an
overlay icon displaying a plus sign is displayed in the right upper corner of
the element icon:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/plus-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Icon indicating an added model element.</p>
<p>You can differ if the element is added locally or remotely by the overlay icon
in the lower right corner indicating the model element state, which is
described in section <a href="#state">Model Element State Indication</a>.
Thus, a barrel icon or a locked sign icon combined with the plus icon indicates
that the model element has been deleted by another user. In that case, an
update might be useful.</p>
<p>Whereas the checkmark icon combined with the plus icon indicates 
that the element is locally added and not committed yet.</p>
<h3 id="deleted">Deleted Element</h3>
<p>In case a model element is deleted from the repository by another
user, an overlay icon displaying a cross sign is displayed in the right upper corner of
the element icon:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cross-remotely-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Icon indicating a remotely deleted model element.</p>
<p>You can differ if the element is deleted locally or remotely by the overlay icon
in the lower right corner indicating the model element state, which is
described in section <a href="#state">Model Element State Indication</a>.
Thus, a barrel icon or a locked sign icon combined with the cross icon indicates
that the model element has been deleted by another user. In that case, an
update might be useful.</p>
<p>Whereas the checkmark icon combined with the cross icon indicates 
that the element is locally deleted.</p>-->


<h2 id="state">Model Element State Indication</h2>
<p>In the Outline view, the lock state of model elements are indicated in
the lower right corner of the model elements icon. The following states are
possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#shared">Shared Mode</a></li>
    <li><a href="#locked">Locked State</a></li>
    <li><a href="#lockedUser">Locked by another User</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shared">Shared Mode</h3>
<p>In case a model element is shared with the repository, but not
locked, the following overlay icon indicates this state:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/barrel-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Shared Mode</p>
<h3 id="locked">Locked State</h3>
<p>In case a model element is locked for editing, a checkmark icon
indicates that state:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/checkmark-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Locked State</p>
<h3 id="lockedUser">Locked by another User</h3>
<p>In case a model element is locked by another user, the following
icon is indicating this state:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/locked-other-user-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Locked by another User</p>
<p>Additionally the name of the user who locked this element is
added to the right side of the model element name, e.g.:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/locked-by-user.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Name of the User who locked the Element.</p>
<h2 id="external">External Model Information Resources</h2>
<p>In case an already existing model element is imported from an external
model resource, the original version will be replaced. A confirmation dialog
opens, where you can choose to replace the existing element or to
reuse the element in the model:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/external-model-overwrite.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Replacement Dialog</p>

<p>The corresponding 
model elements have to be locked for editing before this action.
Otherwise, an according error message requesting to lock the model
elements before the import is displayed.</p>
<p>Please refer to the chapter
<a href="../mg-registry.html">External Model Resources</a> for
general information on working with external model resources.</p>
