<h2 id="requirements">Preparing for Concurrency Control</h2>
<p>The Concurrency Control functionality is only available in case you have a 
project with a connection to a Subversion repository and your model is shared
with this connection.
To work with a shared project you either have to check out an existing project
from the repository or share a local project with the repository.</p>

<h3>Subversion Connection</h3>
<p>You need an Subversion (SVN) repository added to your workspace to work in concurrency
mode. To add an existing 
Subversion repository to your workspace:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Windows &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other &gt; SVN Repository Exploring</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Add SVN Repository</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>In the upcoming dialog enter the URL of your repository location.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For detailed information on adding an SVN connection, please refer to
the <strong>Subclipse - Subversion Eclipse Plugin</strong> documentation 
(Workbench User Guide &gt; Getting started &gt; Team SVN tutorial &gt;
Creating a new Repository Location).</p>
<h3 id="share">Sharing a Project</h3>
<p>In case you want to use a local project for concurrency mode, you have to share this project
with an SVN repository. To share a project:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click your project in the Package Explorer.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Team &gt; Share Project</strong>.
<p class="image"><img src="images/share-project.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong></p></li>
    <li>Select <strong>SVN</strong> as repository plug-in.
    <p class="image"><img src="images/share-project-svn.png" alt=""></p></li>
    <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>Create a new repository location or use an existing repository location.</li>
    <li>In the latter case browse to the existing location.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/share-project-rep.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For detailed information on sharing a project, please refer to
the <strong>Subclipse - Subversion Eclipse Plugin</strong> documentation
(Workbench User Guide &gt; Getting started &gt; Team SVN tutorial 
&gt; Connect an Existing Project with SVN).</p>
<h3 id="checkout">Checking out existing Projects</h3>
<p>To check out an existing project:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Switch to the <strong>SVN Repositories</strong> perspective.</li>
    <li>Go to the location of your project.</li>
    <li>Select the project and choose <strong>Checkout</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For detailed information on checking out existing projects from the repository,
 please refer to the <strong>Subclipse - Subversion Eclipse Plugin</strong> documentation
(Workbench User Guide &gt; Getting started &gt; Team SVN tutorial &gt; Checkout).</p>

<h3 id="checkoutRep">Checking out Models from the Repository</h3>
<p>In case a new model has been checked in by another user, you can
check out this model and its lock files from the repository.
Synchronizing your project with the repository indicates if new models
have been added. For detailed information on synchronizing with a repository,
please refer to the <strong>Subclipse - Subversion Eclipse Plugin</strong> 
documentation (Reference &gt; Team Menu &gt; Team Synchronizing Perspective ).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Please make sure that you use the latest version of a model element for 
concurrency control, otherwise it might lead to inconsistencies.</p>
<h2 id="adding">Adding Concurrency Control to Process Models</h2>
<p>To add concurrency control to a model, right-click the model in the Outline view
and select <strong>Add Concurrency Management</strong>. With this action a
commit to the repository is invoked automatically.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/add-concurrency.png"
    alt="Adding Concurrency Control"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Add Concurrency Control.</p>
<p>If the model is in <a href="con-introduction.html#version">version management mode</a>,
the necessary lock files are created and the model state is switched to
concurrency mode. In case the model is in <a href="con-introduction.html#local">local
file mode</a>, the model file is checked into the subversion repository.</p>
<p>In case a model has been shared before and changes are performed
in local mode, it is not possible to share this model again. You have
to check out a clean copy of the model from the repository and repeat the
changes. An according warning message is opening to inform you about these
necessary steps:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/share-operation-warning.png"
    alt="Sharing Warning Message"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Warning Message for already Shared Model.</p>
<h2 id="prefs">Setting Concurrency Preferences</h2>
<p>You can set the following preferences for handling the Concurrency
Management Control:</p>
<ul>
    <li>enable and enter a rate for a refresh job to periodically refresh
	informations from the repository. Please note that the value must be an
	Integer between 30 and 7200 (seconds).</li>
    <li>enable and set a retry rate in seconds in case of connection failure.
     Please note that the value must be an
	Integer between 30 and 7200 (seconds).</li>
</ul>
<p>To set these preferences, open the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Window &gt; Preferences</strong>.</li>
    <li><span>Expand the <strong>Process Manager</strong> entry in the left
    pane and select <strong>Concurrency Management Preferences</strong>.</span></li>
    <li><span>Now you can set your preferences.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/preferences.png" alt="Concurrency Preferences"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Concurrency Management Preferences.</p>
<h2 id="disconnect">Disconnecting From Concurrency Control</h2>
<p>To exit the <strong>Concurrency Management Mode</strong>, right-click the
model in the Outline view and select <strong>Disconnect From Concurrency Management</strong>:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/disconnect.png"
    alt="Disconnect From Cocurrency Control"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Disconnect From Concurrency Control.</p>
<p>The following steps are performed automatically during a disconnect to
ensure that the disconnect is not called by several users simultaneously or one
after another:</p>
<ul>
    <li>locking and updating the XPDL</li>
    <li>removing lock folder and all collaboration extended attributes</li>
    <li>saving and committing the XPDL file</li>
    <li>locking the folder</li>
    <li>unlocking the XPDL file</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lockFiles">Lock Files</h2>
<p>For all separately lockable model elements, lock files are created in a
model specific directory inside the same project. All lock files are added and
committed to the version control system, when the <strong>Concurrency Management Mode</strong>
is switched on. To be able
to track changes, lock files are modified and committed upon changes of these
model elements. A number that will be incremented on
each commit of a changes of an element is stored in the according lock files.</p>

<h3>Lock File Naming</h3>
<p>The names of lock files look are composed as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;project_root&gt;/.MODEL_&lt;GUID&gt;/&lt;element_type&gt;/&lt;element_type&gt;__&lt;element_uuid&gt;.lck</pre>
<p>Whereby:</p>
<ul>
    <li>MODEL_&lt;GUID&gt; is a GUID generated on entering the concurrency mode and saved in the model extended attributes</li>
    <li>element_type corresponds the EMF specific name feature, for example: <tt>processDefinition__ProcessDefinition_1.lck</tt></li>
    <li>element UUID, this number is saved with the element in its extended attributes and does not change, e.g. on element renaming.</li>
</ul>
<!--  <h2 id="offline">Working Offline</h2>
<p>You can work offline on process models. Locked model elements can be modified without server connectivity.</p>-->

<h2 id="upgrade">Upgrading Models</h2>
<p>Upgrading a model requires a lock on all model elements as obtained by the 
<strong>Lock All for Editing</strong> option. Please refer to section
<a href="con-locking.html#lockAll">Locking all Lockable Elements</a> of chapter
<a href="con-locking.html">Locking and Unlocking Elements</a> for information on this
option. For a model upgrade, the lock on all
model elements is obtained implicitly.</p>
