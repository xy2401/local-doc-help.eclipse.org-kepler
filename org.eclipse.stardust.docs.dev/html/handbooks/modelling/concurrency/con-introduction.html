<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Stardust supports concurrent work on process models
stored in a central repository.</p>

</ul>
<p>To make collaborative modeling work, you need to install plug-ins required for
version control system support. Refer to section 
<a href="#vcs">Version Control System Support</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="modes">Collaborative Modeling Modes</h2>
<p>You may work on a Stardust model file in three different modes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#local">Local File Mode</a></li>
    <li><a href="#version">Version Management Mode</a></li>
    <li><a href="#con">Concurrency Management Mode</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In a modeling environment, a model always knows about its state regarding the
above modes and behaves differently depending on this state, for example concerning
editing.</p>
<h3 id="local">Local File Mode</h3>
<p>Working in <strong>Local File Mode</strong> means working on a plain XPDL file.</p>
<h3 id="version">Version Management Mode</h3>
<p>When working in <strong>Version Management Mode</strong>, the XPDL file is
checked into SVN and managed as any other programming artefact. The following diagram
illustrates the structure of a development project in 
<strong>Version Management Mode</strong>:</p>

<h3 id="con">Concurrency Management Mode</h3>
<p>When working in <strong>Concurrency Management Mode</strong>, the XPDL file is
checked into SVN and concurrent modeling is managed via auxiliary lock files. The following
diagram illustrates the structure of a development project in 
<strong>Concurrency Management Mode</strong>:</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concurrency Management Mode Locking Concept</h2>
<p>The <strong>Concurrency Management Mode</strong> adds the concept of locking
specific model elements for update in addition to the regular version management.
Obtaining a lock enables the lock owner to update a model element and write these changes back.</p>

<h2 id="vcs">Version Control System Support</h2>
<p>Stardust supports the open source version
control system <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> for 
concurrency control. 
Make sure to install the <strong>Stardust Modeling VCS-Connector</strong> plug-in.
For installation details, please refer to the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.installation/html/installation/ig-toc.html">Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The plug-ins should be listed in your Eclipse 
plug-in details after restarting Eclipse with the <tt>-clean</tt> option.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>Please note that the concurrency mode only changes user operations in the modeling environment. 
The Stardust Portals and command line utilities are not affected.</p>
