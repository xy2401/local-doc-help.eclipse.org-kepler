<h1>Locking and Unlocking Elements</h1>
<p>In the <strong>Concurrency Management Mode</strong> specific model
elements can be locked for editing. Obtaining a lock enables the lock owner to
perform changes on a model element and write these changes back.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#separat">Separately Lockable Model Elements</a></li>
    <li><a href="#editOption">Locking Elements for Editing</a></li>
    <li><a href="#lockAll">Locking all Lockable Elements</a></li>
    <li><a href="#release">Releasing Locks</a></li>
    <li><a href="#force">Force Unlock on Existing Foreign Locks</a></li>
    <li><a href="#problem">Lock Failed Error - Item is out of date</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="separat">Separately Lockable Model Elements</h2>
<p>The following elements of a process model can be locked separately:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the model itself</li>
    <li>structured type definitions</li>
    <li>process definitions</li>
    <li>model diagrams</li>
    <li>data</li>
    <li>applications</li>
    <li>participants</li>
    <li>link types</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="editOption">Locking Elements for Editing</h2>
<p>Before an element can be locked, it will be checked, if remote changes exist. In 
that case, the element has to be updated first. Please refer to the chapter
<a href="con-update.html">Updating Model and Model Elements</a> for detailed
information on updating elements. Newly created model elements
have no locks per default. According lock files are created during a commit.</p>
<p>All nodes in the model Outline view representing lockable elements as listed in
the section
<a href="#separat">Separately Lockable Model Elements</a>,
provide the <strong>Lock for Editing</strong> option in their context-menu. This option is
enabled if the model element is not already locked. To lock an
element, right-click the according node in the Outline view and select 
<strong>Lock for Editing</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/edit-element.png" alt="Select Edit."><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lock Element for Editing.</p>
<p>In cases changes have been performed on this model element and committed
meanwhile by another user,
a warning dialog opens, indicating that an update is necessary first:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/update-first.png" alt="Update First Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Warning Dialog for updating first.</p>
<p>If a model element is locked for editing, this is indicated via an overlay icon
presenting a checkmark, in the right
lower corner of the element icon in the Outline view.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/edit-icon.png" alt="Edit Icon"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Icon to indicate Edit Mode for a Process Definition.</p>
<p>Please note that locking the model itself will not lock all lockable
model elements implicitly. Please refer to
the section <a href="#lockAll">Locking all Lockable Elements</a> in case you want
to lock all lockable elements in a model.</p>
<h2 id="lockAll">Locking all Lockable Elements</h2>
<p>Locking a model itself will not lock all lockable
model elements implicitly. It only locks model specific properties. In case
you like to lock all lockable elements in a model, right-click
the model in the Outline view and choose the
option <strong>Lock All For Editing</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lock-all-for-editing.png" alt="Lock All"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lock All for Editing Option.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Model upgrades require a lock on all model elements. For model upgrade, the lock
on all model elements is obtained implicitly.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
In case of the referenced model elements,
external model information (like File Connection) and External Model References can be added, 
removed and modified only if the Model Node is locked.


<h3 id="implUpdate">Implicit Update Operations Requiring A Global Lock</h3>
<p>The following actions require all model elements to be locked:</p>
<ul>
    <li>modifying organizational hierarchies in model diagrams</li>
    <li>model upgrades</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="release">Releasing Locks</h2>
<h3 id="implicit">Implicit Lock Release</h3>
<p>Locks are implicitly released if changes on a model element are committed and the option 
<strong>Keep Locks</strong> is disabled in the commit dialog.
Please refer to the section <a href="con-commit.html#dialog">The Commit Dialog</a>
of the chapter <a href="con-commit.html">Committing Changes</a> for
information on this option.</p>
<h3 id="explicit">Explicit Lock Release</h3>
<p>Locked elements can be unlocked explicitly without committing,
in case you like to revert your local changes. 
In this case right-click the according node
in the Outline view and select <strong>Revert Changes</strong>.
Please refer to the chapter <a href="con-revert.html">Reverting Changes</a>
for detailed information.</p>

<h2 id="force">Force Unlock on Existing Foreign Locks</h2>
<p>In case a foreign lock is not released by a user, it can be explicitly
released by a user, who has the permission to force unlocks. By default, all
users have the permission to force unlocks. To change this behavior, administrators
have the option to prohibit the permission for specific users. Please refer to
section <a href="#prohibit">Prohibiting Force Unlock for Specific Users</a>
for details.</p>
<p>Having the permission, you can force unlocking
existing foreign locks to other users by
selecting <strong>Force Unlock All</strong> in the model 
context-menu in the Outline view:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/force-unlock-all.png"
alt="Force Unlock All"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Force Unlock All</p> 
<p>The following dialog opens before the unlock
is performed to confirm the unlock and give you information about the option:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/force-unlock-warning.png"
alt="Force Unlock Warning"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Force Unlock Warning</p> 
<p>After selecting <strong>OK</strong>, another dialog opens where you can
explicitly select the 
model elements, where an unlock on all foreign locks should be performed on:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/force-unlock-dialog.png"
alt="Force Unlock Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Force Unlock Dialog</p>
<p>In case a force unlock operation is tried from a user not having the 
permission to, an according error message opens.</p>
<!--<p class="image"><img src="images/unlock-error-dialog.png"
alt="Force Unlock Error Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Force Unlock Error Dialog</p>-->

<h3 id="prohibit">Prohibiting Force Unlock for Specific Users</h3>
<p>By default, all users have the permission to perform an unlock all. Administrators
have the possibility to prohibit force unlock for specific users by creating 
SVN hooks. Thus it can be decided when lock creation and lock
releases are allowed to happen. This can be performed via SVN repository hooks. 
In case you are an administrator and like to use this functionality, please refer to the
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks">
Implementing Repository Hooks</a> section of the SVN documentation 
for detailed information on creating hooks.</p>
<p>The <tt>pre-lock</tt> and <tt>pre-unlock</tt> hooks allow administrators to 
decide when lock creation and lock releases are allowed to happen. 
Depending on whether or not a lock already exists, these two hooks can 
decide whether or not to allow a certain user to break or steal a lock. 
The <tt>post-lock</tt> and <tt>post-unlock</tt> hooks are also available, and can be used to 
send email after locking actions.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Lock Failed Error - Item is out of date</h2>
<p>When trying to lock an element, it might happen that you get an exception
indicating that the item is out of date, as in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/lock-problem_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/lock-problem.png" alt="Lock Error"></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lock Failed Message</p>
<p>The lock file might be out of date, 
if another user just released a lock on this element and the refresh
job is not running during your locking process.
As a workaround, you can either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>close and reopen your model, or</li>
	<li>set another refresh rate in the 
	<strong>Concurrency Management Preferences</strong>.<br>Please refer to the
	section <a href="con-control.html#prefs">Setting Concurrency Preferences</a>
	of the chapter <a href="con-control.html">Concurrency Control</a> for detailed
	information on setting concurrency preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, after the lock folder is refreshed, locking is working without problems again.</p>
