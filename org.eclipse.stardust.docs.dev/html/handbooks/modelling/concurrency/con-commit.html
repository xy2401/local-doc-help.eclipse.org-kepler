<h1>Committing Changes</h1>
<p>In case a model element is locked and has local changes, these changes
can be committed to the subversion repository.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#steps">The Commit Process</a></li>
    <li><a href="#commit">Committing Model Element Changes</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dialog">The Commit Changes Dialog</a></li>
    <li><a href="#conflict">Conflicting IDs On Model Element Commit</a></li>
<!--    <li><a href="#merge">Merging Changes</a></li>-->
</ul>
<h2 id="steps">The Commit Process</h2>
<p>During a commit, the following steps will be performed
automatically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Potential collisions (e.g. two data with same IDs) are checked
    for, to ensure that the commit does not introduce inconsistencies. In case
    of inconsistencies, try to resolve them as described in the section
    <a href="#conflict">Conflicting IDs on Model Element Commit</a>.</li>
    <li>It will be checked that locks obtained were not released by the
    administrator.</li>
    <li>Remote changes are merged into the local model to all model
    elements that are not locked.</li>
    <li>The changes are committed and lock files are created for new
    elements.</li>
    <li>Locks will be released if not requested otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commit">Committing Model Element Changes</h2>
<p>All model element nodes in the model Outline view representing lockable
elements provide the option <strong>Commit Changes</strong>. To commit a change
for an element, right-click its node in the Outline view and select <strong>Commit
Changes</strong>.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/commit-element-changes.png" alt="Committing Model Element Changes."><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Committing Model Element Changes.</p>
<p>Please note that the model has to be saved before this operation. Otherwise
a warning dialog opens.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/save-model-warning.png"
    alt="Save Warning"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Warning indicating to save Model first.</p>
<h2 id="dialog">The Commit Changes Dialog</h2>
<p>After selecting the option to commit, a <strong>Commit Changes Dialog</strong> opens,
where you can select the changes on model elements you like to commit. It displays
all changed and thus locked model elements and new elements with
checkboxes to select for committing. A checkbox <strong>Keep Lock</strong>
is provided to choose if the locks of the selected elements
should be kept after the commit.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/commit-dialog-model.png" 
alt="Commit Changes Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> The Commit Changes Dialog.</p>
<p>Overlay icons indicate the sort of changes on elements.
The pen icon indicates changes on an element that already existed:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/pen-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Changed Model Element.</p>
<p>The plus icon indicates that an element has been added to the model:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/plus-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Added Model Element.</p>
<p>The cross icon indicates that an existing element has been deleted from
the model:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cross-icon.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Deleted Model Element.</p>
<p>Also an entry field for a commit comment is provided. A commit comment
is obligatory, otherwise the <strong>OK</strong> button is not enabled. Please
enter at least 10 characters.</p>
<p>After the <strong>OK</strong> button is selected, all selected changes will be
merged with the model file in the repository. Committing a changed element increments
 the counter of the element lock file. To cancel the commit select <strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="commitAll">Committing All Changes in a Model</h3>
<p>To commit all changes in a model, select the
<strong>All Elements</strong> entry. All elements pertaining to the 
model and having changes will be selected for committing. </p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/commit-all-changes.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Commit all Changed Elements in a Model.</p>
<h2 id="conflict">Conflicting IDs On Model Element Commit</h2>
<p>Conflicts on IDs might occur during a commit of model elements, for example
if a commit results in having two elements with the same ID in the repository.
In that case a dialog opens to indicate that a duplicate ID or name exists and to
offer to change them directly in appropriate entry fields:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/merge-dupl-id.png" alt="Conflict Dialog"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Dialog to change ID or Name.</p>
<p>After giving the element a new ID and closing this dialog,
 the commit process continues.</p>
