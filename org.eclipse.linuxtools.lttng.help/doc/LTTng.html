		<h2 id="Project_View">Project View</h2>
		<p>The project view is the standard Eclipse Project Explorer. 
			<b>Tracing</b> projects are well integrated in the Eclipse's Common Navigator Framework. The Project Explorer shows 
			<b>Tracing</b> project with a small "T" decorator in the upper right of the project folder icon.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_a_Tracing_Project">Creating a Tracing Project</h3>
		<p>A new 
			<b>Tracing</b> project can be created using the New Tracing Project wizard. To create a new 
			<b>Tracing</b>  select 
			<b>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</b> from the main menu bar or alternatively form the context-sensitive menu (click with right mouse button in the 
			<b>Project Explorer</b>.
		</p>
		<p>The first page of project wizard will open.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewTracingProjectPage1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In the list of project categories, expand category 
			<b>Tracing</b> and select 
			<b>Tracing Project</b> and the click on 
			<b>Next &gt;</b>. A second page of the wizard will show. Now enter the a name in the field 
			<b>Project Name</b>, select a location if required and the press on

		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewTracingProjectPage2.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A new project will appear in the 
			<b>Project Explorer</b> view.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewProjectExplorer.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Tracing projects have two sub-folders: 
			<b>Traces</b> which holds the individual traces, and 
			<b>Experiments</b> which holds sets of traces that we want to correlate.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Importing_Traces_in_a_Project">Importing Traces in a Project</h3>
		<h4 id="Batch_Importing">Batch Importing</h4>
		<p>The 
			<b>Batch Import Trace Wizard</b> allows users to search their media for traces and import multiple traces of varying trace types simultaneously. It also handles name clashes and renaming of traces.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Traces</b> folder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To import a set of traces to the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder, one can open the 
			<b>Import...</b> menu from the 
			<b>File</b> main menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importImportMenu.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Then select 
			<b>Batch Trace Import</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importMenuSelect.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Or one can select the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder by double clicking on the project name.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importSelectTracingProject.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Then click the right mouse button on the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder. Then select 
			<b>Batch Import...</b> menu item in the context-sensitive menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importBatchImport.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>At this point, the 
			<b>Batch import wizard</b> is opened.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Available trace types</b> page is visible. Select a trace type to scan for by clicking an item in trace types tree. If one selects a parent element, the new state will be propagated to the children.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importSelectTraceTypeToImport.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>When that is done, the warning message will go away and the user can click 
			<b>Next &gt;</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importSelectTraceTypeComplete.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Then select one or more files or directories to scan for traces. The directories added will be recursively scanned, all children files and directories will be scanned. This can be slow depending on the size of the directory to scan.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importSelectFilesToScan.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>One can add a directory by clicking on 
			<b>Add Directory...</b> then selecting a directory to import.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importSelectedDirectory.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>One can also add a file by clicking on 
			<b>Add File...</b> then selecting a file to import.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importAddFile.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once the files and directories are selected, a background scanner will already start scanning them for potential matches. to select the candidates, click 
			<b>Next &gt;</b>.
		</p>
		<p>Here the user will see the results of the scan. The list will grow as more files are scanned.
			To select a trace to import, first open a trace type.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importScan1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Then select the trace to import.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importScan2.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>When that is done, typically one can press 
			<b>Finish</b>, and the trace will be imported. They can set the trace to be 
			<b>linked</b> or 
			<b>copied</b>. A 
			<b>linked</b> trace is not copied to the user's workspace, rather, the original file is used. This is useful for traces that are very large and that the user does not want to copy several times. 
			<b>Copied</b> traces are as their name indicates, copied to the local workspace. This is useful if there is a trace on a network or on some removable media. The user can also specify if the trace should 
			<b>overwrite</b> the resources in the workspace or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importScan3.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>One can select several traces also and import them simultaneously. In this case there is a problem, the name of both traces are the same, this is a conflicting name and needs to be resolved.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importScan4.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To do so, select one of the conflicting traces, then 
			<b>click on its name</b>. Then type in a new name.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importScan5.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Here the traces shall be copied instead of linked.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importScan6.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>At this point, press 
			<b>Finish</b> to import the traces.
		</p>
		<p>If the 
			<b>Finish</b> button is grayed, or if the user wishes to import to a different project, they need to press 
			<b>Next &gt;</b>. The user then needs to select a project to import to on the 
			<b>options</b> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importOptions.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>You will then see the traces in the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder as shown below and can 
			<b>open</b> them by 
			<b>double-clicking</b> on them. For more details on how to open a trace see section 
			<a href="#Opening_a_Trace_or_Experiment">Opening a Trace or Experiment</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/importImages/importFinish.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Importing">Importing</h4>
		<p>The previous way of importing a trace is still available. To access it, simply  select 
			<b>Import...</b> menu item in the context-sensitive menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ProjectImportTraceAction.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A new display will show for selecting traces to import. By default, it shows the correct destination directory where the traces will be imported to. Now, specify the location of the traces by entering the path directly in the 
			<b>Source Directory</b> or by browsing the file system (click on button browse). Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders. Optionally, select the 
			<b>Trace Type</b> from the drop-down menu, select or deselect the checkboxes for 
			<b>Overwrite existing trace without warning</b> and 
			<b>Create links into workspace</b>. When all options are configured, click on 
			<b>Finish</b>.
		</p>
		<p>Note, that traces of certain types (e.g. LTTng Kernel) are actually a composite of multiple channel traces grouped under a folder. It is the folder that has to be imported.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ProjectImportTraceDialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Upon successful importing the traces will be stored in the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder. If a trace type was selected in the import dialog, then the corresponding icon will be displayed. If no trace type is selected the unknown icon 
			<img border="0" src="images/unknown_parser.gif"/> will be displayed. Linked traces will have a little arrow as decorator on the right bottom corner.
		</p>
		<p>Note that trace type is an extension point of the 
			<b>Tracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF)</b>. Depending on the which features are loaded, the list of trace types can vary.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Trace_Package_Exporting_and_Importing">Trace Package Exporting and Importing</h3>
		<p>A trace package is an archive file that contains the trace itself and can also contain its bookmarks and its supplementary files. Including supplementary files in the package can improve performance of opening an imported trace but at the expense of package size.</p>
		<h4 id="Exporting">Exporting</h4>
		<p>The 
			<b>Export Trace Package Wizard</b> allows users to select a trace and export its files and bookmarks to an archive on a media.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Traces</b> folder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To export a trace contained in the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder, one can open the 
			<b>Export...</b> menu from the 
			<b>File</b> main menu. Then select 
			<b>Trace Package Export</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tracePackageImages/fileExport.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>At this point, the 
			<b>Trace Package Export</b> is opened. The project containing the trace has to be selected first then the trace to be exported.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tracePackageImages/chooseTrace.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>One can also open the wizard and skip the first page by selecting a trace in the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder by double clicking on the project name, double clicking on the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder, right-clicking on the trace then selecting 
			<b>Export Trace Package...</b> menu item in the context-sensitive menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tracePackageImages/exportSelectedTrace.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Next, the user can choose the content to export and various format options for the resulting file.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tracePackageImages/exportPackage.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Trace</b> item is always selected and represents the files that constitute the trace. The 
			<b>Supplementary files</b> items represent files that are typically generated when a trace is opened by the viewer. Sharing these files can speed up opening a trace dramatically but also increases the size of the exported archive file. The 
			<i>Size</i> column can help to decide whether or not to include these files. Lastly, by selecting 
			<b>Bookmarks</b>, the user can export all the bookmarks so that they can be shared along with the trace.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>To archive file</b> field is used to specify the location where to save the resulting archive.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Options</b> section allows the user to choose between a tar archive or a zip archive. Compression can also be toggled on or off.
		</p>
		<p>When Finish button is clicked, the package is generated and saved to the media.</p>
		<h4 id="Importing_2">Importing</h4>
		<p>The 
			<b>Import Trace Package Wizard</b> allows users to select a previously exported trace package from their media and import the content of the package in the workspace.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Traces</b> folder holds the set of traces for a tracing project. To import a trace package to the 
			<b>Traces</b> folder, one can open the 
			<b>Import...</b> menu from the 
			<b>File</b> main menu. Then select 
			<b>Trace Package Import</b>.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tracePackageImages/importTraceFolder.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>At this point, the 
			<b>Trace Package Import Wizard</b> is opened.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tracePackageImages/importPackage.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>From archive file</b> field is used to specify the location of the trace package to export. The user can choose the content to import in the tree.
		</p>
		<p>If the wizard was opened using the File menu, the destination project has to be selected in the 
			<b>Into project</b> field.
		</p>
		<p>When Finish is clicked, the trace is imported under the project's Trace folder.</p>

		<p>Note that the directory for all supplementary files will be deleted, too. (see also 
			<a href="#Deleting_Supplementary_Files">Deleting Supplementary Files</a>).
		</p>
		<h3 id="Deleting_Supplementary_Files">Deleting Supplementary Files</h3>
		<p>Supplementary files are by definition trace specific files that accompany a trace. These file could be temporary files, persistent indexes or any other persistent data files created by the LTTng integration in Eclipse during parsing a trace. For the LTTng 2.0 trace viewer a persistent state history of the Linux Kernel is created and is stored under the name 
			<b>stateHistory.ht</b>. The statistics for all traces are stored under 
			<b>statistics.ht</b>. Other state systems may appear in the same folder as more custom views are added.
		</p>
		<p>All supplementary file are hidden from the user and are handled internally by the TMF. However, there is a possibility to delete the supplementary files so that there are recreated when opening a trace.</p>
		<p>To delete all supplementary files from a single trace, first, make sure the trace is not opened, then select the relevant trace in the 
			<b>Project Explorer</b> view and click the right mouse button. Then select the 
			<b>Delete Supplementary Files...</b> menu item from the context-sensitive menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/DeleteSupplementaryFilesAction.png"/>

			<b>Project Explorer</b> view and click the right mouse button. Then select 
			<b>Open</b> menu item of the context-sensitive menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/OpenTraceAction.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>When opening a trace or experiment all currently open view will be filled which are defined for the corresponding trace type. Additionally, an internal index will be created for fast navigation within a trace. For LTTng 2.0 kernel traces a persistent state history will also be build. This state history will be used in different views to display kernel state information.</p>
		<h3 id="Drag_and_Drop">Drag and Drop</h3>
		<p>Traces can be also be imported to a project by dragging from another tracing project and dropping to the project's trace folder. The trace will be copied and the trace type will be set.</p>
		<p>Any resource can be dragged and dropped from a non-tracing project, and any file or folder can be dragged from an external tool, into a tracing project's trace folder. The resource will be copied or imported as a new trace, however the trace type will be unknown and need to be set manually by the user.</p>
		<p>To import the trace as a link, use the platform-specific key modifier while dragging the source trace. A link will be created in the target project to the trace's location on the file system.</p>
		<p>It is also possible to drop a trace, resource, file or folder into an existing experiment. If the item does not already exist as a trace in the project's trace folder, it will first be copied or imported, then the trace will be added to the experiment.</p>
		<h3 id="Link_with_Editor">Link with Editor</h3>
		<p>The tracing projects support the feature 
			<b>Link With Editor</b> of the Project Explorer view. With this feature it is now possible to
			<br/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>select a trace element in the Project Explorer view and the corresponding 
				<a href="#Events_Editor">Events Editor</a> will get focus if the relevant trace is open.
			</li>
			<li>select an 
				<a href="#Events_Editor">Events Editor</a> and the corresponding trace element will be highlighted in the Project Explorer view.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To enable or disable this feature toggle the 
			<b>Link With Editor</b> button of the Project Explorer view as shown below.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/TMF_LinkWithEditor.png"/>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Events_Editor">Events Editor</h2>
		<p>The Events editor shows the basic trace data elements (events) in a tabular format. The editors can be dragged in the editor area so that several traces may be shown side by side. These traces are synchronized by timestamp.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/LTTng2EventsEditor.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The header displays the current trace (or experiment) name.</p>
		<p>Being part of the 
			<b>Tracing and Monitoring</b> Framework, the default table displays the following fields:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Timestamp</b>: the event timestamp
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Source</b>: the source of the event
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Type</b>: the event type and localization
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Reference</b> the event reference
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Content</b>: the raw event content
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The first row of the table is the header row a.k.a. the Search and Filter row.</p>
		<p>The highlighted event is the 
			<i>current event</i> and is synchronized with the other views. If you select another event, the other views will be updated accordingly. The properties view will display a more detailed view of the selected event.
		</p>
		<p>An event range can be selected by holding the 
			<b>Shift</b> key while clicking another event or using any of the cursor keys (
			<b>Up</b>', 
			<b>Down</b>, 
			<b>PageUp</b>, 
			<b>PageDown</b>, 
			<b>Home</b>, 
			<b>End</b>). The first and last events in the selection will be used to determine the current selected time range for synchronization with the other views.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/LTTng2EventProperties.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The Events editor can be closed, disposing a trace. When this is done, all the views displaying the information will be updated with the trace data of the next event editor tab. If all the editor tabs are closed, then the views will display their empty states.</p>
		<h3 id="Searching_and_Filtering">Searching and Filtering</h3>
		<p>Searching and filtering of events in the table can be performed by entering matching conditions in one or multiple columns in the header row (the first row below the column header).</p>
		<p>To toggle between searching and filtering, click on the 'search' (
			<img border="0" src="images/TmfEventSearch.gif"/>) or 'filter' (
			<img border="0" src="images/TmfEventFilter.gif"/>) icon in the header row's left margin, or right-click on the header row and select 
			<b>Show Filter Bar</b> or 
			<b>Show Search Bar</b> in the context menu.
		</p>
		<p>To apply a matching condition to a specific column, click on the column's header row cell, type in a 
			<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular expression</a> and press the 
			<b>ENTER</b> key. You can also enter a simple text string and it will be automatically be replaced with a 'contains' regular expression.
		</p>
		<p>When matching conditions are applied to two or more columns, all conditions must be met for the event to match (i.e. 'and' behavior).</p>
		<p>To clear all matching conditions in the header row, press the 
			<b>DEL</b> key.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Searching">Searching</h4>
		<p>When a searching condition is applied to the header row, the table will select the next matching event starting from the top currently displayed event. Wrapping will occur if there is no match until the end of the trace.</p>
		<p>All matching events will have a 'search match' icon in their left margin. Non-matching events will be dimmed.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/DefaultTmfEvents-Search.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Pressing the 
			<b>ENTER</b> key will search and select the next matching event. Pressing the 
			<b>SHIFT-ENTER</b> key will search and select the previous matching event. Wrapping will occur in both directions.
		</p>
		<p>Press 
			<b>ESC</b> to cancel an ongoing search.
		</p>
		<p>Press 
			<b>DEL</b> to clear the header row and reset all events to normal.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Filtering">Filtering</h4>
		<p>When a filtering condition is entered in the head row, the table will clear all events and fill itself with matching events as they are found from the beginning of the trace.</p>
		<p>A status row will be displayed before and after the matching events, dynamically showing how many matching events were found and how many events were processed so far. Once the filtering is completed, the status row icon in the left margin will change from a 'stop' to a 'filter' icon.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/DefaultTmfEvents-Filter.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Press 
			<b>ESC</b> to stop an ongoing filtering. In this case the status row icon will remain as a 'stop' icon to indicate that not all events were processed.
		</p>
		<p>Press 
			<b>DEL</b> or right-click on the table and select 
			<b>Clear Filters</b> from the context menu to clear the header row and remove the filtering. All trace events will be now shown in the table. Note that the currently selected event will remain selected even after the filter is removed.
		</p>
		<p>You can also search on the subset of filtered events by toggling the header row to the Search Bar while a filter is applied. Searching and filtering conditions are independent of each other.</p>
		<h4 id="Bookmarking">Bookmarking</h4>
		<p>Any event of interest can be tagged with a bookmark.</p>
		<p>To add a bookmark, double-click the left margin next to an event, or right-click the margin and select 
			<b>Add bookmark...</b>. Alternatively use the 
			<b>Edit</b> &gt; 
			<b>Add bookmark...</b> menu. Edit the bookmark description as desired and press 
			<b>OK</b>.
		</p>
		<p>The bookmark will be displayed in the left margin, and hovering the mouse over the bookmark icon will display the description in a tooltip.</p>
		<p>The bookmark will be added to the 
			<b>Bookmarks</b> view. In this view the bookmark description can be edited, and the bookmark can be deleted. Double-clicking the bookmark or selecting 
			<b>Go to</b> from its context menu will open the trace or experiment and go directly to the event that was bookmarked.
		</p>
		<p>To remove a bookmark, double-click its icon, select 
			<b>Remove Bookmark</b> from the left margin context menu, or select 
			<b>Delete</b> from the Bookmarks view.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Bookmarks.png"/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Event_Source_Lookup">Event Source Lookup</h3>
		<p>For CTF traces using specification v1.8.2 or above, information can optionally be embedded in the trace to indicate the source of a trace event. This is accessed through the event context menu by right-clicking on an event in the table.</p>
		<h4 id="Source_Code">Source Code</h4>
		<p>If a source file is available in the trace for the selected event, the item 
			<b>Open Source Code</b> is shown in the context menu. Selecting this menu item will attempt to find the source file in all opened projects in the workspace. If multiple candidates exist, a selection dialog will be shown to the user. The selected source file will be opened, at the correct line, in its default language editor. If no candidate is found, an error dialog is shown displaying the source code information.
		</p>
		<h4 id="EMF_Model">EMF Model</h4>
		<p>If an EMF model URI is available in the trace for the selected event, the item 
			<b>Open Model Element</b> is shown in the context menu. Selecting this menu item will attempt to open the model file in the project specified in the URI. The model file will be opened in its default model editor. If the model file is not found, an error dialog is shown displaying the URI information.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Exporting_To_Text">Exporting To Text</h3>
		<p>It is possible to export the content of the trace to a text file based on the columns displayed in the events table. If a filter (see 
			<b>
				<a href="#Filtering">Filtering</a>
			</b>) was defined prior exporting only events that match the filter will be exported to the file. To export the trace to text, press the right mouse button on the events table. A context-sensitive menu will show. Select the 
			<b>Export To Text...</b> menu option. A file locater dialog will open. Fill in the file name and location and then press on 
			<b>OK</b>. A window with a progress bar will open till the export is finished.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Note</i>:  The columns in the text file are separated by tabs.    
		</p>
		<h2 id="Histogram_View">Histogram View</h2>
		<p>The Histogram View displays the trace events distribution with respect to time. When streaming a trace, this view is dynamically updated as the events are received.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/HistogramView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Hide Lost Events</b> toggle button 
			<img border="0" src="images/hide_lost_events.gif"/> in the local toolbar allows to hide the bars of lost events. When the button is selected it can be toggled again to show the lost events.
		</p>
		<p>On the top left, there are three text controls:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Selection Start</b>: Displays the start time of the current selection
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Selection End</b>: Displays the end time of the current selection
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Window Span</b>: Displays the current zoom window size in seconds
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The controls can be used to modify their respective value. After validation, the other controls and views will be synchronized and updated accordingly. To modify both selection times simultaneously, press the link icon 
			<img border="0" src="images/link.gif"/> which disables the 
			<b>Selection End</b> control input.
		</p>
		<p>The large (full) histogram, at the bottom, shows the event distribution over the whole trace or set of traces. It also has a smaller semi-transparent orange window, with a cross-hair, that shows the current zoom window.</p>
		<p>The smaller (zoom) histogram, on top right, corresponds to the current zoom window, a sub-range of the event set.</p>
		<p>The x-axis of each histogram corresponds to the event timestamps. The start time and end time of the histogram range is displayed. The y-axis shows the maximum number of events in the corresponding histogram bars.</p>
		<p>The vertical blue line(s) show the current selection time (or range). If applicable, the region in the selection range will be shaded.</p>
		<p>The mouse can be used to control the histogram:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Left-click</b>: Set a selection time
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Left-drag</b>: Set a selection range
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Shift-left-click or drag</b>: Extend or shrink the selection range
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Middle-click or Ctrl-left-click</b>: Center the zoom window on mouse (full histogram only)
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Middle-drag or Ctrl-left-drag</b>: Move the zoom window
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Right-drag</b>: Set the zoom window
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Shift-right-click or drag</b>: Extend or shrink the zoom window (full histogram only)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Mouse wheel up</b>: Zoom in
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Mouse wheel down</b>: Zoom out
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Hovering the mouse over an histogram bar pops up an information window that displays the start/end time of the corresponding bar, as well as the number of events (and lost events) it represents. If the mouse is over the selection range, the selection span in seconds is displayed.</p>
		<p>In each histogram, the following keys are handled:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Left Arrow</b>: Moves the current event to the previous non-empty bar
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Right Arrow</b>: Moves the current event to the next non-empty bar
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Home</b>: Sets the current time to the first non-empty bar
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>End</b>: Sets the current time to the last non-empty histogram bar
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Statistics_View">Statistics View</h2>
		<p>The Statistics View displays the various event counters that are collected when analyzing a trace. The data is organized per trace. To open the Statistics View, select Windows -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other... -&gt; Tracing -&gt; Statistics. A new view will open with the name Statistics. This view shows 3 columns: 
			<i>Level</i> 
			<i>Events total</i> and 
			<i>Events in selected time range</i>. After parsing a trace the view will display the number of events per event type in the second column and in the third, the currently selected time range's event type distribution is shown. The cells where the number of events are printed also contain a colored bar that indicates the percentage of the event count in relation to the total number of events. The statistics is collected for the whole trace. This view is part of the 
			<b>Tracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF)</b> and is generic. It will work for any trace type extensions. For the LTTng 2.0 integration the Statistics view will display statistics as shown below.:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/LTTng2StatisticsView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>By default, the statistics use a state system, therefore will load very quickly once the state system is written to the disk as a supplementary file.</p>
		<h2 id="Colors_View">Colors View</h2>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ColorsView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The Colors view allows the user to define a prioritized list of color settings.</p>
		<p>A color setting associates a foreground and background color (used in any events table), and a tick color (used in the Time Chart view), with an event filter.</p>
		<p>In an events table, any event row that matches the event filter of a color setting will be displayed with the specified foreground and background colors. If the event matches multiple filters, the color setting with the highest priority will be used.</p>
		<p>The same principle applies to the event tick colors in the Time Chart view. If a tick represents many events, the tick color of the highest priority matching event will be used.</p>
		<p>Color settings can be inserted, deleted, reordered, imported and exported using the buttons in the Colors view toolbar. Changes to the color settings are applied immediately, and are persisted to disk.</p>
		<h2 id="Filters_View">Filters View</h2>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/FiltersView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The Filters view allows the user to define preset filters that can be applied to any events table.</p>
		<p>The filters can be more complex than what can be achieved with the filter header row in the events table. The filter is defined in a tree node structure, where the node types can be any of 
			<b>EVENTTYPE</b>, 
			<b>AND</b>, 
			<b>OR</b>, 
			<b>CONTAINS</b>, 
			<b>EQUALS</b>, 
			<b>MATCHES</b> or 
			<b>COMPARE</b>. Some nodes types have restrictions on their possible children in the tree.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>EVENTTYPE</b> node filters against the event type of the trace as defined in a plug-in extension or in a custom parsers. When used, any child node will have its field combo box restricted to the possible fields of that event type.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>AND</b> node applies the logical 
			<i>and</i> condition on all of its children. All children conditions must be true for the filter to match. A 
			<i>not</i> operator can be applied to invert the condition.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>OR</b> node applies the logical 
			<i>or</i> condition on all of its children. At least one children condition must be true for the filter to match. A 
			<i>not</i> operator can be applied to invert the condition.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>CONTAINS</b> node matches when the specified event 
			<i>field</i> value contains the specified 
			<i>value</i> string. A 
			<i>not</i> operator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>EQUALS</b> node matches when the specified event 
			<i>field</i> value equals exactly the specified 
			<i>value</i> string. A 
			<i>not</i> operator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>MATCHES</b> node matches when the specified event 
			<i>field</i> value matches against the specified 
			<i>regular expression</i>. A 
			<i>not</i> operator can be applied to invert the condition.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>COMPARE</b> node matches when the specified event 
			<i>field</i> value compared with the specified 
			<i>value</i> gives the specified 
			<i>result</i>. The result can be set to 
			<i>smaller than</i>, 
			<i>equal</i> or 
			<i>greater than</i>. The type of comparison can be numerical, alphanumerical or based on time stamp. A 
			<i>not</i> operator can be applied to invert the condition.
		</p>
		<p>Filters can be added, deleted, imported and exported using the buttons in the Filters view toolbar. Changes to the preset filters are only applied and persisted to disk when the 
			<b>save filters</b> button is pressed.
		</p>
		<p>To apply a saved preset filter in an events table, right-click on the table and select 
			<b>Apply preset filter...</b> &gt; 
			<i>filter name</i>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Time_Chart_View">Time Chart View</h2>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/TimeChartView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The Time Chart view allows the user to visualize every open trace in a common time chart. Each trace is display in its own row and ticks are display for every punctual event. As the user zooms using the mouse wheel or by right-clicking and dragging in the time scale, more detailed event data is computed from the traces.</p>
		<p>Time synchronization is enabled between the time chart view and other trace viewers such as the events table.</p>
		<p>Color settings defined in the Colors view can be used to change the tick color of events displayed in the Time Chart view.</p>
		<p>When a search is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to matching events in the Time Chart view are decorated with a marker below the tick.</p>
		<p>When a bookmark is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to the bookmarked event in the Time Chart view is decorated with a bookmark above the tick.</p>
		<p>When a filter is applied in the events table, the non-matching ticks are removed from the Time Chart view.</p>
		<p>The Time Chart only supports traces that are opened in an editor. The use of an editor is specified in the plug-in extension for that trace type, or is enabled by default for custom traces.</p>
		<h2 id="Environment_Variables_View">Environment Variables View</h2>
		<p>A new feature of CTF traces is their ability to store user defined data that is not to be placed in an event. It is generally data that is per-trace specific, such as the tracer version and the trace domain. It will be populated when a trace is loaded if the trace has environment variables. 
			<br/>

			<img border="0" src="images/LTTng2EnvironmentsView.png"/>
			<br/>
			The above picture shows a trace loaded that was collected with the 
			<b>lttng-modules</b> version 
			<b>2</b>.
			<b>0</b>.
			<b>0</b> tracer. It is a 
			<b>kernel</b> trace of the 
			<b>3.2.0-18-generic</b> 
			<b>linux</b> kernel.
		</p>
		<h2 id="State_System_Explorer_View">State System Explorer View</h2>
		<p>The State System Explorer view allows the user to inspect the state interval values of every attribute of a state system at a particular time.</p>
		<p>The view shows a tree of currently selected traces and their registered state system IDs. For each state system the tree structure of attributes is displayed. The attribute name, quark, value, start and end time, and full attribute path are shown for each attribute.</p>
		<p>To modify the time of attributes shown in the view, select a different current time in other views that support time synchronization (e.g. event table, histogram view). When a time range is selected, this view uses the begin time.</p>
		<h2 id="Call_Stack_View">Call Stack View</h2>
		<p>The Call Stack view allows the user to visualize the call stack per thread over time, if the application and trace provide this information.</p>
		<p>The view shows the call stack information for the currently selected trace.</p>
		<p>The table on the left-hand side of the view shows the threads and call stack. The function name, depth, entry and exit time and duration are shown for the call stack at the selected time.</p>
		<p>Double-clicking on a function entry in the table will zoom the time graph to the selected function's range of execution.</p>
		<p>The time graph on the right-hand side of the view shows the call stack state graphically over time. The function name is visible on each call stack event if size permits. The color of each call stack event is randomly assigned based on the function name, allowing for easy identification of repeated calls to the same function.</p>
		<p>Clicking on the time graph will set the current time and consequently update the table with the current call stack information.</p>
		<p>Shift-clicking on the time graph will select a time range. When the selection is a time range, the begin time is used to update the stack information.</p>
		<p>Double-clicking on a call stack event will zoom the time graph to the selected function's range of execution.</p>
		<p>Clicking the 
			<b>Select Next Event</b> or 
			<b>Select Previous Event</b> or using the left and right arrows will navigate to the next or previous call stack event, and select the function currently at the top of the call stack.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Custom_Parsers">Custom Parsers</h2>
		<p>Custom parser wizards allow the user to define their own parsers for text or XML traces. The user defines how the input should be parsed into internal trace events and identifies the event fields that should be created and displayed. Traces created using a custom parser can be correlated with other built-in traces or traces added by plug-in extension.</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_a_custom_text_parser">Creating a custom text parser</h3>
		<p>The 
			<b>New Custom Text Parser</b> wizard can be used to create a custom parser for text logs. It can be launched several ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Select 
				<b>File</b> &gt; 
				<b>New</b> &gt; 
				<b>Other...</b> &gt; 
				<b>Tracing</b> &gt; 
				<b>Custom Text Parser</b>
			</li>
			<li>Open the 
				<b>
					<a href="#Managing_custom_parsers">Manage Custom Parsers</a>
				</b> dialog, select the 
				<b>Text</b> radio button and click the 
				<b>New...</b> button
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/CustomTextParserInput.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Fill out the first wizard page with the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Log type:</b> Enter a name for the custom log entries, which is also the name of the custom parser.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Time Stamp format:</b> Enter the date and time pattern that will be used to output the Time Stamp.
				<br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: information about date and time patterns can be found here: 
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html</a>
		</p>
		<p>Click the 
			<b>Add next line</b>, 
			<b>Add child line</b> or 
			<b>Remove line</b> buttons to create a new line of input or delete it. For each line of input, enter the following information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Regular expression:</b> Enter a regular expression that should match the input line in the log, using capturing groups to extract the data.
				<br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: information about date and time patterns can be found here: 
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html</a>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Cardinality:</b> Enter the minimum and maximum number of lines matching this line's regular expression that must be found in the log. At least the minimum number of lines must be found before the parser will consider the next line. Child lines will always be considered first.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>Important note:</u> The custom parsers identify a log entry when the first line's regular expression matches (Root Line n). Each subsequent text line in the log is attempted to be matched against the regular expression of the parser's input lines in the order that they are defined (Line n.*). Only the first matching input line will be used to process the captured data to be stored in the log entry. When a text line matches a Root Line's regular expression, a new log entry is started.</p>
		<p>Click the 
			<b>Add group</b> or 
			<b>Remove group</b> buttons to define the data extracted from the capturing groups in the line's regular expression. For each group, enter the following information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Name combo:</b> Select a name for the extracted data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Time Stamp</b>: Select this option to identify the time stamp data. The input's data and time pattern must be entered in the format: text box.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Message</b>: Select this option to identify the main log entry's message. This is usually a group which could have text of greater length.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Other</b>: Select this option to identify any non-standard data. The name must be entered in the name: text box.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Action combo:</b> Select the action to be performed on the extracted data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Set</b>: Select this option to overwrite the data for the chosen name when there is a match for this group.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Append</b>: Select this option to append to the data with the chosen name, if any, when there is a match for this group.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Append with |</b> : Select this option to append to the data with the chosen name, if any, when there is a match for this group, using a | separator between matches.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The 
			<b>Preview input</b> text box can be used to enter any log data that will be processed against the defined custom parser. When the wizard is invoked from a selected log file resource, this input will be automatically filled with the file contents.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>Preview:</b> text field of each capturing group and of the Time Stamp will be filled from the parsed data of the first matching log entry.
		</p>
		<p>In the 
			<b>Preview input</b> text box, the matching entries are highlighted with different colors:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code><span style="background:#FFFF00">&nbsp;Yellow&nbsp;</span></code> : indicates uncaptured text in a matching line.</li>
			<li><code><span style="background:#00FF00">&nbsp;Green&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></code> : indicates a captured group in the matching line's regular expression for which a custom parser group is defined. This data will be stored by the custom parser.</li>
			<li><code><span style="background:#FF00FF">&nbsp;Magenta</span></code> : indicates a captured group in the matching line's regular expression for which there is no custom parser group defined. This data will be lost.</li>
			<li><code>&nbsp;White&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> : indicates a non-matching line.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The first line of a matching entry is highlighted with darker colors.</p>
		<p>By default only the first matching entry will be highlighted. To highlight all matching entries in the preview input data, click the 
			<b>Highlight All</b> button. This might take a few seconds to process, depending on the input size.

		<h2 id="LTTng_Tracer_Control">LTTng Tracer Control</h2>
		<p>The LTTng Tracer Control in Eclipse for the LTTng Tracer toolchain version v2.0 (or later) is done using SSH and requires an SSH server to be running on the remote host. For the SSH connection the SSH implementation of RSE is used. For that a new System Type was defined using the corresponding RSE extension. The functions to control the LTTng tracer (e.g. start and stop), either locally or remotely, are available from a dedicated Control View.</p>
		<p>In the following sections the LTTng 2.0 tracer control integration in Eclipse is described. Please refer to the LTTng 2.0 tracer control command line manual for more details and descriptions about all commands and their command line parameters

			<img border="0" src="images/Session_active.gif"/>. The icon for an inactive session is 
			<img border="0" src="images/Session_inactive.gif"/>.
		</p>
		<p>Each channel can be 
			<b>ENABLED</b> or 
			<b>DISABLED</b>. An enabled channel means that all configured events of that channel will be traced and a disabled channel won't trace any of its configured events. Different icons are displayed depending on the state of the channel. The icon for an enabled channel is  
			<img border="0" src="images/Channel.gif"/> and the icon for a disabled channel is 
			<img border="0" src="images/Channel_disabled.gif"/>.
		</p>
		<p>Events within a channel can be in state 
			<b>ENABLED</b> or 
			<b>DISABLED</b>. Enabled events are stored in the trace when passed during program execution. Disabled events on the other hand won't be traced. Depending on the state of the event the icons for the event is different. An enabled event has the icon
