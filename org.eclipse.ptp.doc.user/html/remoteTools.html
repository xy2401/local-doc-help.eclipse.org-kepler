<h1 id="top">PTP Remote Tools</h1>
<p><b>Remote Tools</b> is a lightweight remote service provider that is included
with the Parallel Tools Platform (PTP).



To access the remote target system, PTP supports a number of
<i>remote service providers</i>. 
Currently supported remote service providers include <b>Remote Tools</b> (part of PTP) and 
the <b>Eclipse Remote Systems Explorer (RSE)</b> which is an optional package that can be installed at any time. 
<b>The preferred remote service provider is Remote Tools</b> which supports all the PTP and Remote Development Tools (RDT) 
functionality, however
some installations use additional features that are only available in RSE. 
Most PTP information is described using <b>Remote Tools</b>, since it is the simplest and easiest to use.</p>

<h2 id="create">Creating Remote Connections</h2>
<p>New connections are typically created when a need for them arises, such as creating a remote or synchronized
project, or a run configuration on a remote target machine. 
To create a new connection to a remote machine, e.g. when creating a <a href="sync.html">synchronized project</a>, 
the new connection information is specified as part of the <b>New Synchronized Project</b> dialog.
<p>

<p>
Select <b>New...</b> and on the <b>Target Environment Configuration</b> dialog, specify a target name
of your choice. Select <b>Remote Host</b> and fill in user name and password. Select
<b>Finish</b> to create the connection.

<h2 id="tunnel">SSH tunneling</h2>
<p>See the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/FAQ#Q:_How_do_I_use_PTP_to_connect_to_a_remote_system_via_an_intermediate_host_.28multi_hop.29">
PTP Wiki FAQ on tunneling</a> for how to set up the tunnel.
For example, pick an unused port > 1024 such as 7373 in this example:
<pre>
ssh -L 7373:&lt;target-host&gt;:22 &lt;intermediate-userid&gt;@&lt;intermediate-host&gt;
</pre>

<p>Then in the connection dialog, Select <b>Advanced...</b> and use the same port number that you specified
from the command line ssh command.
<p>

<!--   -->
<h2 id="edit">Editing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To edit remote connection information after a connection is created, e.g. to change userid, password, etc.,
first select the <b>Remote Environments</b> view. 
<blockquote>
If the view isn't visible, open it via <b>Window > Show View > Other...</b> and under <b>Remote Tools</b>,
select <b>Remote Environments</b>.
<p><img src="images/rt_remEnvOpen.png">
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/rt_remoteEnvironments.png">
<p>To edit a connection, it must first be stopped if it is running.  To stop a connection, select it and use the "red box"
action on the <b>Remote Environments</b> view toolbar.
<p><img src="images/rt_stopConnection.png">
<p>Once stopped, edit the connection via the context menu (right mouse)
<p><img src="images/rt_remoteEnv_edit.png">
<p>Then make any changes to the connection and select <b>Finish</b>
<p><img src="images/rt_editConnection.png">
<p>The connection need not be manually restarted.  It will automatically restart the next
time that communication with the target machine is needed.


<p>
<!--   -->
<h2 id="remove">Removing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To remove a connection, select it in the <b>Remote Environments</b> view, from the context menu
(right mouse), select <b>Remove</b>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!--   -->
<h2 id="shell">Shell access to Remote systems</h2>
<p>For convenient shell access to a remote system with a <b>Remote Tools</b> (or other)
connection, within an Eclipse view, see <a href="remoteTerminal.html">Remote Terminal</a>.

<h2 id="local">Local Connections</h2>
<p>Previous versions of PTP required an ssh connection back to the local machine in order
to launch a parallel application on the local machine.  Now you need only specify <b>Local</b>
for the connection type in the launch configuration.  No "connection" is required.
