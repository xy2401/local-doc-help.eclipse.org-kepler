<h1 id="top">PTP Remote Terminal</h1>
<p><b>Remote Terminal</b> is a lightweight remote terminal that can be used to provide a shell from within Eclipse.
It is included with the Parallel Tools Platform (PTP) and uses the same connection information
that is used by remote and synchronized projects, including <a href="remoteTools.html">Remote Tools</a>.
<p>The <b>Terminal</b> view should be available near the bottom of the workbench
<p>
<img src="images/rterm_wbench.png">
<p>If it is not visible, you can open it via <b>Window > Show View > Other...</b>
and under <b>Terminal</b>, select <b>Terminal</b>.
<p>

<p>The <b>Terminal</b> view is a convenient way to provide shell
access to remote systems, and uses the same connection information that may be in use
already for e.g. a synchronized project.

<p>In the <b>Terminal</b> view, select the <img src="images/rterm_icon_connect.png"> <b>Connect</b> 
<!-- or the <b>New Terminal Connection</b>  -->
button.

<p>

<p><img src="images/rterm_connect2.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next dialog, choose <b>Connection Type:</b> to use e.g. <b>Remote Tools</b>,
and under <b>Settings</b>, select the connection to use. 
If you have not already established a connection, select <b>New...</b>
and enter hostname, user, password, etc.
For more information about creating connections, see <a href="remoteTools.html">Remote Tools</a>.
<p><img src="images/rterm_connect1.png"></p>

<p>Select <b>OK</b> to open the shell on the selected system.
<p><img src="images/rterm_connected.png"></p>
<p>Shell commands can be entered on the selected system.

<h2 id="other">Other Features</h2>
<!-- FIXME caveat these don't seem to work quite right. -->

<p>To create an additional view for another terminal connection use <b>New Terminal View</b>
from the dropdown menu next to the 
<img src="images/rterm_icon_newConn.png"> button in the view toolbar.
<p><img src="images/rterm_newTermView.png"></p>
<p>Then multiple <b>Terminal</b> views will exist, each with a different connection.
